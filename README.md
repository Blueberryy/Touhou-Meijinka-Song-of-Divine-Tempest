# Touhou-Meijinka-Song-of-Divine-Tempest
A thunderous concert appears...
## Info
***Touhou Meijinka ~ Song of Divine Tempest*** is a *Touhou Project* fangame developed by Drillimation Systems in collaboration with Studio Emiko (who wrote the game's plot and script) and E. Enthusiasm (who did most of the game's sprites and background tiles). The game centers on four characters who must seek the source of a mysterious concert draining Gensokyo's audience and causing an endless thunderstorm. The game is intentionally developed in the style of a Super Nintendo game, featuring 16-bit graphics and audio.

## How to Play
*Touhou Meijinka ~ Song of Divine Tempest* can be played using a keyboard or controller. You can also play local multiplayer (two XInput controllers are required for this feature). The goal is pretty much the same as in every other *Touhou* game: Defeat the stage boss to move onto the next stage.

- The arrow keys, left analog stick, and D-pad move the character.
- The Z key and A button shoots.
- The Shift key and B button (the L button does it too) focuses.
- The X key and X button (the R button does it too) uses a spell card.
